  abstract = {Reproducible results define the very core of scientific integrity in modern research. Yet, legitimate concerns have been raised about the reproducibility of research findings, with important implications for the advancement of science and for public support. With statistical practice increasingly becoming an essential component of research efforts across the sciences, this review article highlights the compelling role of statistics in ensuring that research findings in the animal sciences are reproducible\textemdash in other words, able to withstand close interrogation and independent validation. Statistics set a formal framework and a practical toolbox that, when properly implemented, can recover signal from noisy data. Yet, misconceptions and misuse of statistics are recognized as top contributing factors to the reproducibility crisis. In this article, we revisit foundational statistical concepts relevant to reproducible research in the context of the animal sciences, raise awareness on common statistical misuse undermining it, and outline recommendations for statistical practice. Specifically, we emphasize a keen understanding of the data generation process throughout the research endeavor, from thoughtful experimental design and randomization, through rigorous data analysis and inference, to careful wording in communicating research results to peer scientists and society in general. We provide a detailed discussion of core concepts in experimental design, including data architecture, experimental replication, and subsampling, and elaborate on practical implications for proper elicitation of the scope of reach of research findings. For data analysis, we emphasize proper implementation of mixed models, in terms of both distributional assumptions and specification of fixed and random effects to explicitly recognize multilevel data architecture. This is critical to ensure that experimental error for treatments of interest is properly recognized and inference is correctly calibrated. Inferential misinterpretations associated with use of P-values, both significant and not, are clarified, and problems associated with error inflation due to multiple comparisons and selective reporting are illustrated. Overall, we advocate for a responsible practice of statistics in the animal sciences, with an emphasis on continuing quantitative education and interdisciplinary collaboration between animal scientists and statisticians to maximize reproducibility of research findings.},

However, the normality assumption is not fulfilled when dealing with data which does not contain negative values or are otherwise skewed \textendash{} a common occurrence in diverse disciplines such as finance, economics, political science, sociology, philology, biology and physical and industrial processes. In this situation, a lognormal distribution may better represent the data than the normal distribution. In this paper, I re-visit the key attributes of the normal and lognormal distributions, and demonstrate through an empirical analysis of the `number of political parties' in India, how logarithmic transformation can help in bringing a lognormally distributed data closer to a normal one. The paper also provides further empirical evidence to show that many variables of interest to political and other social scientists could be better modelled using the lognormal distribution. More generally, the paper emphasises the potential for improved description and empirical analysis of quantitative data by paying more attention to its distribution, and complements previous publications in Practical Research and Assessment Evaluation (PARE) on this subject.},

At the exit of the primary lagoon a pipe was installed to feed a constant flow of 0.6 m3/day to each of the two constructed wetlands. Each unit had a retention time of 1.12 days and a hydraulic load rate of 0.2 m/day. To evaluate the efficiency of the treatment, physical, chemical and biological parameters were monitored for three consecutive months. Water samples in the influent and effluent of each experimental wetland were analyzed. At the end of the monitoring, Cyperus Papyrus had a better removal of total phosphorus (50\%), ammoniacal nitrogen (69.69\%), biochemical oxygen demand (69.87\%), chemical oxygen demand (80.69\%), total coliforms (98.08\%) and fecal coliforms (95.61\%).

  abstract = {Pseudoreplication is defined as the use of inferential statistics to test for treatment effects with data from experiments where either treatments are not replicated (though samples may be) or replicates are not statistically independent. In ANOVA terminology, it is the testing for treatment effects with an error term inappropriate to the hypothesis being considered. Scrutiny of 176 experimental studies published between 1960 and the present revealed that pseudoreplication occurred in 27\% of them, or 48\% of all such studies that applied inferential statistics. The incidence of pseudoreplication is especially high in studies of marine benthos and small mammals. The critical features of controlled experimentation are reviewed. Nondemonic intrusion is defined as the impingement of chance events on an experiment in progress. As a safeguard against both it and preexisting gradients, interspersion of treatments is argued to be an obligatory feature of good design. Especially in small experiments, adequate interspersion can sometimes be assured only by dispensing with strict randomization procedures. Comprehension of this conflict between interspersion and randomization is aided by distinguishing pre-layout (or conventional) and layout-specific alpha (probability of type I error). Suggestions are offered to statisticians and editors of ecological journals as to how ecologists' understanding of experimental design and statistics might be improved.},

  abstract = {Accurate determination of biochemical methane potential (BMP) is important for both biogas research and practice. However, access to laboratory equipment limits the capacity of small laboratories or biogas plants to conduct reliable BMP assays, especially in low- and middle-income countries. This paper describes the development and validation of a new gas density-based method for measuring BMP (GD-BMP). In the GD-BMP method, biogas composition is determined from biogas density. Biogas density is based on bottle mass loss and biogas volume, and these can be accurately measured using only a standard laboratory scale, inexpensive syringes, and a simple manometer. Results from four experiments carried out in three different laboratories showed that the GD-BMP method is both accurate (no significant bias compared to gravimetric or volumetric methods with biogas analysis by gas chromatography) and precise (\&lt;3\% relative standard deviation is possible). BMP values from the GD-BMP method were also comparable to those measured for the same substrates with an industry standard automated system (AMPTS II) in two independent laboratories (maximum difference 10\%). Additionally, the GD-BMP method was shown to be accurate even in the presence of leakage by excluding leakage from mass loss measurements. The proposed GD-BMP method represents a significant breakthrough for both biogas research and the industry. With it, accurate BMP measurement is possible with only a minimal investment in supplies and equipment.},

The performance of each inoculum was tested with four different substrates, namely sewage sludge, dried whole crop maize, food waste, and microcrystalline cellulose as a typical reference material. The results revealed that the choice of inoculum had no significant impact on the specific methane yield of the tested substrates except for cellulose. Still, the specific methane production rate was significantly influenced by the choice of the inoculum especially for sewage sludge, but also for food waste and cellulose, whereas it became clear that an inoculum adapted to a substrate is beneficial for a speedy digestion.},

Recent research suggests that silage is a major source of VOCs emitted from agriculture, but only limited data exist on silage emissions. Ethanol is the most abundant VOC emitted from corn silage; therefore, ethanol was used as a representative compound to characterize the pattern of emission over time and to quantify the effect of air velocity and temperature on emission rate. Ethanol emission was measured from corn silage samples removed intact from a bunker silo. Emission rate was monitored over 12 h for a range in air velocity (0.05, 0.5, and 5 m s-1) and temperature (5, 20, and 35 \textdegree C) using a wind tunnel system. Ethanol flux ranged from 0.47 to 210 g m-2 h-1 and 12 h cumulative emission ranged from 8.5 to 260 g m-2. Ethanol flux was highly dependent on exposure time, declining rapidly over the first hour and then continuing to decline more slowly over the duration of the 12 h trials. The 12 h cumulative emission increased by a factor of three with a 30 \textdegree C increase in temperature and by a factor of nine with a 100-fold increase in air velocity. Effects of air velocity, temperature, and air-filled porosity were generally consistent with a conceptual model of VOC emission from silage. Exposure duration, temperature, and air velocity should be taken into consideration when measuring emission rates of VOCs from silage, so emission rate data obtained from studies that utilize low air flow methods are not likely representative of field conditions.},

While many studies have reported the efficiency of BSFL to bio-convert a wide range of organic waste streams into larval biomass, so far, it is unknown whether BSFL prefer certain waste streams over others when they have the possibility to choose. Here, we performed a choice-test experiment to explore the preference of BSFL when exposed to pig manure and a mass-rearing diet consisting of plant by-products currently used for industrial BSFL production. We found that after 1 hr of exposure to both feeds, BSFL strongly preferred pig manure over the mass-rearing diet. The preference for manure became stronger as larval age increased. Our results provide the first evidence that BSFL express a distinct diet preference. Understanding the reasons for the strong preference for manure is relevant for a diverse array of practical applications and to inform the discussion on insect welfare.},
